generations:
  - name: "First Generation (XF10)"
    start_year: 1990
    end_year: 1994
    description: "The original Lexus LS 400 revolutionized the luxury sedan market, establishing the Lexus brand with its exceptional quality, refinement, and value. Developed under the top-secret F1 project ('Flagship One'), it featured a silky-smooth 4.0-liter V8 producing 250 horsepower, paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. The exterior design was intentionally conservative but elegant, with excellent aerodynamics for its time. The interior set new standards for noise isolation (famously demonstrated in the 'champagne glass' commercial), material quality, and attention to detail. Advanced features included a power-adjustable steering wheel, memory seats, and an electrochromic rearview mirror. The engineering was obsessive, with 1,400 engineers working for nearly five years to develop a vehicle that matched or exceeded established European luxury sedans in every measurable metric. The first-generation LS established Lexus's reputation for exceptional quality, reliability, and customer service, fundamentally changing the luxury car market."

  - name: "Second Generation (XF20)"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 2000
    description: "The second-generation LS maintained the fundamental virtues of the original while addressing its few shortcomings. The exterior styling evolved subtly with more sculptured surfaces and improved proportions. The 4.0-liter V8 was enhanced to produce 260 horsepower, paired with a smoother five-speed automatic transmission. The interior was thoroughly revised with improved ergonomics, more luxurious materials, and additional features including a premium Nakamichi sound system and enhanced climate control. Structural rigidity increased substantially, further improving the already impressive refinement and ride quality. Safety technology expanded with front and side airbags, vehicle stability control, and enhanced braking systems. A minor revision in 1998 brought additional refinements and standard features. This generation further solidified the LS's reputation for exceptional quality and reliability while enhancing its luxury credentials, establishing it as a legitimate alternative to established European luxury sedans."

  - name: "Third Generation (XF30)"
    start_year: 2001
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The third-generation LS featured more distinctive styling, although still relatively conservative, with a slightly larger body providing increased interior space. The new 4.3-liter V8 engine produced 290 horsepower, paired with a five-speed automatic transmission (later a six-speed). Technological innovations included the first production LED taillights, adaptive cruise control, a DVD-based navigation system, and Bluetooth phone connectivity. Significant innovations included climate-controlled seats, power-closing doors, a power trunk lid, and advanced parking guidance. Safety features expanded with knee airbags, adaptive headlights, and pre-collision systems. The ultra-luxury LS 430 models featured premium Mark Levinson audio, heated and cooled rear seats, and rear-seat massage functions. This generation maintained Lexus's reputation for quality and refinement while adding significant technological innovations, further elevating the LS as a world-class luxury sedan."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (XF40)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The fourth-generation LS represented the most significant redesign to date, with more expressive styling and advanced technology. Two models were offered: the standard wheelbase LS 460 and the long-wheelbase LS 460L, both powered by a new 4.6-liter V8 producing 380 horsepower, paired with the world's first eight-speed automatic transmission. The LS 600h L hybrid variant combined a 5.0-liter V8 with electric motors for enhanced performance and efficiency. The interior featured exceptional craftsmanship with hand-polished wood trim, semi-aniline leather, and available executive rear seating with ottoman and massage functions. Technological innovations included the Advanced Parking Guidance System for automated parallel parking, a hard-drive based navigation system, and a 19-speaker Mark Levinson Reference sound system. A significant refresh in 2013 introduced the spindle grille design and updated technology features. Throughout its long production run, this generation maintained Lexus's reputation for quality while offering unprecedented luxury features and technological sophistication, though it faced increasing competition from revitalized European rivals."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (XF50)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: null
    description: "The current LS represents the most dramatic redesign in the model's history, with expressive styling featuring a bold spindle grille, complex surfacing, and a coupe-like roofline despite its large size. Built on the new GA-L platform shared with the LC coupe, it features significantly improved structural rigidity and a lower center of gravity for enhanced handling. Initially offered as the LS 500 with a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 producing 416 horsepower and 442 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and the LS 500h hybrid combining a 3.5-liter V6 with two electric motors for a total system output of 354 horsepower. The interior showcases extraordinary craftsmanship with available hand-pleated door panels, cut glass inserts, and kiriko glass ornamentation inspired by Japanese aesthetics. Technological features include a 24-inch head-up display, 23-speaker Mark Levinson audio system, and the comprehensive Lexus Safety System+ 2.0. Executive packages offer four-zone climate control, 22-way adjustable rear seats with massage, and a rear-seat entertainment system. A refresh for 2021 brought improved suspension tuning, updated technology with a touchscreen replacing the Remote Touch controller, and enhanced driver assistance features. The fifth-generation LS embraces a more distinctive design philosophy and driving character while maintaining the model's traditional strengths in comfort, refinement, and quality, positioning it as a unique alternative to established European luxury sedans."
